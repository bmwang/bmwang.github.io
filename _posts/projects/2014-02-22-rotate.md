I wanted to learn how to make an iPhone app in Objective-C. What better way
is there to learn a new language than hacking on it for a day, in a trial by
fire? We went from not knowing Objective-C to an OpenGL game in 12 hours,
not using any graphics or game frameworks.

It's very heavily inspired by Super Hexagon. You are the triangle, and you move
by touching the left or right side of the screen. The goal is to avoid the 
solid blocks coming at you for as long as possible.

I wanted to learn how to make an iPhone app in Objective-C.
My group at the EA Code Jam  went from not knowing Objective-C to a playable
OpenGL game in 12 hours. The game is pure Objective-C and OpenGL, with no
additional libraries.

It's very heavily inspired by Super Hexagon. You are the triangle, and you move
by touching the left or right side of the screen. The goal is to avoid the 
solid blocks coming at you for as long as possible.

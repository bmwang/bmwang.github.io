#introduction
I took CS184, Solid Modeling in Spring 2011 with Carlo Sequin.

#course site
All of my projects in this class required me to take screenshots of my 
results and place it on 
[a webpage](http://static.brandonwang.net/class/cs184/). I'm still 
transitioning to my new site, so be wary of 404 links.

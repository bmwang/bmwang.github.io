#introduction
HasView is a visual Haskell editor, similar to 
[LabView](http://www.ni.com/labview/). HasView programs compile into 
GHC-compliant Haskell.

#background
Kaushik Iyer and I created HasView as our final project for CS264, the 
graduate programming languages course at Berkeley. 

Initially inspired by a visualization of an implementation of 
[doubly linked lists in Haskell](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Tying_the_Knot), 
and the difficulty of reading the code without a dataflow picture, I was convinced 
that an illustration of Haskell would greatly help in understanding them.

Kaushik and I came across John Reekie's [Visual Haskell](http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/~johnr/papers/visual.html). Visual Haskell takes in a Haskell program and displays an illustration of its dataflow. Inspired, we set to create the reverse of Visual Haskell, a Visual Haskell editor - one where users would input a picture, and we would generate the Haskell resulting from it.

Our survey of the CS264 class found that advanced programmers generally 
disliked visual languages for the unneeded additional actions required to 
generate any actions - a simple program would take far more work to _piece_ 
together, than to think about.

Our attempt at making Haskell more understandable at a programming perspective 
was to target these advanced programmers, so we decided that we would 
not follow the path and implement many small primitives for the language, 
forcing the repetition of many blocks, like an addition, but to 
allow arbitrary Haskell in a node, and simply provide an interface to 
visually program the flow of information through a Haskell program.

#technical
The project was written entirely in Python, using PyQT for the user interface. 

HasView operates on nodes with arbitrary Haskell written inside it, and 
specifying the input and output variables. We serialize the logic by 
determining an order of execution within each enclosure. We then resolve the 
variable bindings, assigning names to each intermediate output.

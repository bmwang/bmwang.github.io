CNM 190, Advanced Digital Animation, taught by Dan Garcia, was a more 
art-driven class, focused on creating an animated short over the course of
two semesters.

The class was split in to two teams. I, along with Wesley Fuh, SiSi Shan,
Ben Wu, Juan de Joya, Jessica Miller, Jason Zhou, Jessica Tran, Katrina Chang, 
Brian Chan, and Michelle Fang worked together to create Paper Magicion.

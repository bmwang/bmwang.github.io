Holoify takes an arbitrary OBJ model and makes a hologram shader. Open source
on [GitHub](https://github.com/bmwang/holoify). Disclaimer: hacky code.

Runs in real-time through OpenGL.

It works by creating vertices in through a tessellation shader, and displaces
the created vertices through a vertex shader. The vertex shader moves a point
along a weighted curve with time, and heavily spends more time closer to
the original geometry. The displacement happens along the normal of the
original geometry.

An additional framebuffer fade is added to allow the points to glow, and become
white, and a small bloom post-process is further added to make the points
glow.

[eAthena](http://eathena.ws/board/) is an open-source Ragnarok Online server 
emulator, and the first large software project I worked on. The project is no 
longer actively maintained, but active forks exist.

eAthena was my introduction to non-web programming. I joined the development 
team when I was 13, out of frustration with the official Ragnarok Online 
servers. I primarily developed NPCs and occasionally core server features 
under the aliases of Evera and Aria. The project served more than a hundred 
thousand users while I was an active developer.

My contributions can still be seen today, and it serves as a reminder for 
the reason why I started to pursue Computer Science. 
[rAthena](http://rathena.org/) and [Hercules](http://hercules.ws/) are current
active forks.

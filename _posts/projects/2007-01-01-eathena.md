[eAthena](http://eathena.ws/board/) is an open-source Ragnarok Online server 
emulator. I am no longer an active developer, nor is the project actively 
maintained. This was the first large project I worked on.

#background
eAthena was my introduction to non-web programming. I joined the development 
team when I was 13, out of frustration with the official Ragnarok Online 
servers. I primarily developed NPCs and occasionally core server features 
under the aliases of Evera and Aria. The project server more than a hundred thousand 
users while I was an active developer.

My contributions can still be seen today, and it serves as a reminder for 
the reason why I started to pursue Computer Science. 
[rAthena](http://rathena.org/) is the current active fork.

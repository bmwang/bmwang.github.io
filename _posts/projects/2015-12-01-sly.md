excerpt: A toy example of a nodegraph in AngularJS. I just wanted to learn Angular.

[Live Demo](http://home.brandonwang.me:3000/). Hit `Preset 1`

I just make random projects to learn new languages and frameworks.

This time, I made a nodegraph in [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/).

This isn't the nodegraph I made at Pixar. I can't share that one.

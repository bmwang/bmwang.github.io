Inertia is a real-time futuristic racing game inspired by the 
[WipEout series](http://www.wipeouthd.com/). It features a procedural track 
generator, a few nice rendering effects, and a decent gameplay experience.
This was done in about 3 weeks, as a final project for CS184.  
My [class report](http://s3.brandonwang.net/projects/inertia/InertiaReport.pdf)
is available online.

# Background
Inertia was my [CS184](http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs184/sp11/) final 
project, done with Andrew Lee and Chris Tandiono in Spring 2011. We were 
given about three weeks to develop the game from almost scratch. 

# Technical
Our project was written entirely in [C++](http://en.wikiaedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B),
utilizing [OpenGL](http://www.opengl.org/), 
[OpenAL](http://connect.creativelabs.com/openal/default.aspx), 
[GLUT](http://freeglut.sourceforge.net/), 
[GLEW](http://glew.sourceforge.net/), and 
[FreeImage](http://freeimage.sourceforge.net/download.html).

Our technical achievements were:

- __Real-time gameplay__: The game can be played using a keyboard or gamepad, 
  and we made it a top priority to keep the gameplay smooth.
- __Crepuscular Rays__: We used GLSL to implement a GPU-based post-process
  crepuscular ray effect.
- __Soft Shadows__: We used variance shadow maps.
- __Procedural Track Generation__: The track is procedurally generated 
  utilizing b-splines, with physical constraints to make the track feasible
- __Procedural City Generation__: The city surrounding the track is also
  procedurally generated.
- __Physics__: Inertia features a simple simulation of momentum and force. 
  Because of its inertia, the ship will drift, and can be challenging to 
  drive.
- __Heads-up Display__: We have a simple heads-up display to show the game's
  mechanics, such as the lap time or velocity.
- __Custom Soundtrack__: Inertia features its own unique soundtrack, created
  by the team members.
- __Cross-platform__: Our game runs on any operating system, and the limiting
  factor is the support of OpenGL - our game runs smoothly even on a 2010
  MacBook Air.
- __Texture Mapping__: The ship and its environment is texture mapped.

On Coco, I was the lead developer of Flow, a completely new in-house surfacing
tool. Flow is a nodegraph-based tool, interfacing with a GPU-backed interactive
renderer, using [NVIDIA OptiX](https://developer.nvidia.com/optix)

Flow focused on a simple artist-driven workflow, and allowed for shading
artists to focus on shading art and debugging, rather than pipeline woes.
We matched BSDFs with our RenderMan production renderer, and focused on
procedural pattern generation, at full film quality.

The nodegraph shown in the video is my Python-based shading nodegraph
originally created for Katana.

Flow was used 4 months into development to start shading props on Coco.

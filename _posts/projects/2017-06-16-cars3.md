With our back-end pipeline completely ripped out in the studio for Finding
Dory, our shading and rendering pipeline became very application-specific and
rigid. I transitioned the shading in the studio to a cross-application
[USD](http://graphics.pixar.com/usd/overview.html)-based representation,
allowing for shading authoring to take place in a multitude of applications,
including a text editor.

I also wrote more shaders and supported them.

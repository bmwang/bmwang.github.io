# Hi. I'm Brandon.

## This is a site about me.

I like programming, pretty pictures, math, science, movies, video games, and rain.  
I have a partuclar interest in computer graphics because it combines everything I like.

I currently work at [Pixar Animation Studios](http://www.pixar.com/) , where I write software that uses [math](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rendering_equation) and [physics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_transport_theory) to put colors on the screen.  
I learned how to do this at [The University of Californa, Berkeley](http://www.berkeley.edu/index.html), where I earned a B.S. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, and a M.S. in Computer Science.  
(No, I am not an animator.)

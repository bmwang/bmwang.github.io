  I'm a M.S. student studying Computer Science at UC Berkeley, under Ravi Ramamoorthi's guidance. I graduated with a B.S. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science in three years, also from UC Berkeley. As a computer graphics focus, I am primarily interested in rendering, procedural generation, and simulation.

  I am currently working as a Software Intern at Pixar Animation Studios. In the Fall, I will be returning to UC Berkeley, where I will continue to take classes, and work as a teaching assistant for CS184,
  Foundations of Computer Graphics.

  I have previously worked at Qualcomm and the Department of Defense. For more information, take a look at my resume!
